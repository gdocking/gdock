# Disclaimer

I am by no means an expert in genetic algorithms, and do not aspire this software to compete with any of the tens of dozens similar software out there. It was idealized as an exercise in programming and to test a few concepts.

I am also aware that there is still very much to be done and improved. Check the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to help/criticize (:

# Concept

In the project we apply [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to protein-protein docking. Each individual is represented by its cartesian coordinates and euler angles, and the fitness of each is given by a scoring function.

The input of each simulation is two [PDB files](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/introduction), one receptor and one ligand; plus a list of residues that are likely to play a part in the interaction. There is (and will not be) support for _ab initio_ experiments.

Initial placement of the molecule is done so that each of the residues that are likely to be in the interface are facing each other, this is the starting point for the genetic algorithm. From here on, all geometric opertions will be done in the ligand. Each individual (could be intepreted as a conformation) is generated by randomly three floats that will describe a region in space (around the geometric center of the initial ligand positioning) and three more floats that will describe its rotation. 

The fitness of each one of these individual is evaluated (each of the conformations is scored) and over each generation, individuals have a chance of mutation, where one of the six descriptors is randomly changed and crossover, where individuals exchange descriptors.
